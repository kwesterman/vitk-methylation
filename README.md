Analysis of DNA methylation and vitamin K supplementation response.

- EWAS comparing 24 responders and 24 non-responders to phylloquinone supplementation.
- Secondary EWAS of baseline plasma phylloquinone concentrations in the same individuals.

Numbered scripts correspond to the sequence of steps in the methylation preprocessing pipeline. vitk_response_ewas_v2.Rmd contains the EWAS analysis and produces the plots and tables to be used in the associated manuscript.
